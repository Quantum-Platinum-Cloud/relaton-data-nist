abstract:
  content: The Manufacturing USA Program’s 2019 reauthorization allows the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to renew Manufacturing USA institute
    support, subject to a “rigorous merit review.” Following an initial five to seven-year
    cooperative agreement in which federal support must be cost-matched by at least
    a 1:1 match of non-federal co-investment over the performance period of the award,
    NIST-funded institutes are now eligible to apply for renewal of their support.
    This document describes the institute renewal process, with a focus on the performance
    standards for the merit review.
