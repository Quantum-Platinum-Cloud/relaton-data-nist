abstract:
- content: 'The field of cryptography continues to advance at a very rapid pace, leading
    to new insights that may impact the security properties of cryptographic algorithms.
    The Crypto Publication Review Board ("the Board") has been established to identify
    publications to be reviewed. This report subjects the first standard to the review
    process: Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 197, which defines the
    Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).'
